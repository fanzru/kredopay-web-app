   → No sender/recipient balance mutations

3. Liquidity Fog Pools
   → Shared capital, zero attribution
   → Privacy by design
   → Capital efficiency through pooling

4. Programmable Permissions
   → Set spending limits, time windows, categories
   → Role-based access for teams
   → Revocable without asset movement

## 📝 Key Messages untuk Komunitas

### **Core Value Propositions:**

1. **"Banking Without Accounts"**

   - No wallets to secure
   - No addresses to expose
   - No balances to track
   - Just authorization and intent

2. **"Privacy by Design"**

   - Zero-knowledge proofs by default
   - No identity leakage
   - No transaction history tracking
   - Structural privacy, not optional

3. **"Authorization-Based Finance"**

   - Spend without custody
   - Programmable permissions
   - Revocable access
   - Intent-driven payments

4. **"Infrastructure, Not Property"**
   - Liquidity as shared resource
   - Capital efficiency through pooling
   - No honeypot wallets
   - System-wide capital reuse

### **Differentiators:**

- ✅ **No Balance Display** - Users never see "their balance" because it doesn't exist
- ✅ **Authorization-First UI** - Focus on "what you can do" not "what you have"
- ✅ **Privacy by Default** - All interactions use ZK proofs
- ✅ **Intent-Driven** - All payments start from intent, not transfer
- ✅ **Policy-Centric** - Permissions are first-class citizens
