Zero custody. Pure ZK-Auth. The new standard is inevitable.

**Question:** "What makes you superior to $pbank (pumpbank.org)? Are you a Bank/DeFi protocol also like PBANK? Tempted to ape KREDO but need to know if you have a working product?"

**Answer:**

```
Great question! Here's what makes Kredo fundamentally different:

🏦 PumpBank: Email + Password login (custodial risk if password leaked)
👁️ Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords to hack, no custody)

🏦 PumpBank: Auto-generates Solana wallet + stores encrypted private keys
👁️ Kredo: Pure authorization layer - spend without custody

🏦 PumpBank: You own funds in your wallet = you're responsible for security
👁️ Kredo: You prove authorization = system handles security

Key differences:

1. AUTHENTICATION
   PumpBank: Email + Password (AES-256 encrypted keys stored)
   Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords, no keys, nothing to steal)

2. WALLET MANAGEMENT
   PumpBank: Auto-generated Solana wallet per user
   Kredo: No wallets exist - ZERO CUSTODY architecture

3. PRIVATE KEYS
   PumpBank: Encrypted & stored on server (single point of failure)
   Kredo: No private keys to manage or lose

4. SECURITY MODEL
   PumpBank: Password breach = wallet compromised
   Kredo: No passwords, no keys = nothing to compromise

5. ARCHITECTURE
   PumpBank: Account-based (stake → borrow → repay → unstake)
   Kredo: Accountless (prove authorization → spend → done)

6. ON-CHAIN STATE
   PumpBank: Per-user wallet addresses stored
   Kredo: Zero user state, only liquidity fog pools

7. PRIVACY
   PumpBank: All transactions tied to your wallet address
   Kredo: No attribution, no tracking, pure ZK proofs

Working product? Dashboard launching soon with:
✓ Virtual cards (create, freeze, delete)
✓ Email + OTP auth (no passwords)
✓ Real-time ZK proof generation
✓ No wallet connection needed

We're not building a better bank.
We're building banking without accounts.

PumpBank optimizes custody.
Kredo eliminates custody.

## Alternative Shorter Version

```
PumpBank = Better traditional bank (email + password)
Kredo = Banking without accounts (email + OTP only)

Key difference:
🏦 They: You own money, you secure it
👁️ Us: You prove authorization, system secures it

No passwords to hack.
No wallets to lose.
No accounts to track.

Just pure ZK authorization.

Dashboard launching soon.

## Technical Deep Dive Version

```
@Crypto94 - Excellent question. Let me break down the fundamental differences:

AUTHENTICATION:
• PumpBank: Email + Password (if password leaks = game over)
• Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords = nothing to hack)

ARCHITECTURE:
• PumpBank: Account-based (traditional banking model)
• Kredo: Accountless (authorization-based model)

CUSTODY:
• PumpBank: Users hold funds in accounts
• Kredo: Users never hold funds, only prove spending rights

PRIVACY:
• PumpBank: Account balances are tracked
• Kredo: No balances, no accounts, no tracking

SECURITY MODEL:
• PumpBank: Secure your password = secure your money
• Kredo: Prove authorization = spend without custody risk

ON-CHAIN STATE:
• PumpBank: Per-user accounts stored
• Kredo: Zero user state, only liquidity pools

WORKING PRODUCT:
Dashboard launching with:
✓ Virtual cards (CRUD operations)
✓ Email + OTP auth (passwordless)
✓ SQLite backend (persistent)
✓ Toast notifications (modern UX)
✓ Freeze/unfreeze cards
✓ Real-time updates

We're not competing with PumpBank.
We're in a different category entirely.

They optimize banking.
We eliminate accounts.

## Ultra-Bullish Short Version

```
What makes Kredo superior?

We don't have accounts.

Not "better accounts"
Not "decentralized accounts"
Not "private accounts"

NO ACCOUNTS.

You can't hack what doesn't exist.

Banking without accounts.
The new standard.
