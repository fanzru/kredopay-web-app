Accounts are a security flaw.

We are building the world's first Accountless Financial OS.

Zero custody. Pure ZK-Auth. The new standard is inevitable.

## Twitter Response to Crypto94

**Question:** "What makes you superior to $pbank (pumpbank.org)? Are you a Bank/DeFi protocol also like PBANK? Tempted to ape KREDO but need to know if you have a working product?"

**Answer:**

```
Great question! Here's what makes Kredo fundamentally different:

🏦 PumpBank: Email + Password login (custodial risk if password leaked)
👁️ Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords to hack, no custody)

🏦 PumpBank: Auto-generates Solana wallet + stores encrypted private keys
👁️ Kredo: Pure authorization layer - spend without custody

🏦 PumpBank: You own funds in your wallet = you're responsible for security
👁️ Kredo: You prove authorization = system handles security

Key differences:

1. AUTHENTICATION
   PumpBank: Email + Password (AES-256 encrypted keys stored)
   Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords, no keys, nothing to steal)

2. WALLET MANAGEMENT
   PumpBank: Auto-generated Solana wallet per user
   Kredo: No wallets exist - ZERO CUSTODY architecture

3. PRIVATE KEYS
   PumpBank: Encrypted & stored on server (single point of failure)
   Kredo: No private keys to manage or lose

4. SECURITY MODEL
   PumpBank: Password breach = wallet compromised
   Kredo: No passwords, no keys = nothing to compromise

5. ARCHITECTURE
   PumpBank: Account-based (stake → borrow → repay → unstake)
   Kredo: Accountless (prove authorization → spend → done)

6. ON-CHAIN STATE
   PumpBank: Per-user wallet addresses stored
   Kredo: Zero user state, only liquidity fog pools

7. PRIVACY
   PumpBank: All transactions tied to your wallet address
   Kredo: No attribution, no tracking, pure ZK proofs

Working product? Dashboard launching soon with:
✓ Virtual cards (create, freeze, delete)
✓ Email + OTP auth (no passwords)
✓ Real-time ZK proof generation
✓ No wallet connection needed

We're not building a better bank.
We're building banking without accounts.

PumpBank optimizes custody.
Kredo eliminates custody.
```

## Alternative Shorter Version

```
PumpBank = Better traditional bank (email + password)
Kredo = Banking without accounts (email + OTP only)

Key difference:
🏦 They: You own money, you secure it
👁️ Us: You prove authorization, system secures it

No passwords to hack.
No wallets to lose.
No accounts to track.

Just pure ZK authorization.

Dashboard launching soon.

## Technical Deep Dive Version

```
@Crypto94 - Excellent question. Let me break down the fundamental differences:

AUTHENTICATION:
• PumpBank: Email + Password (if password leaks = game over)
• Kredo: Email + OTP only (no passwords = nothing to hack)

ARCHITECTURE:
• PumpBank: Account-based (traditional banking model)
• Kredo: Accountless (authorization-based model)

CUSTODY:
• PumpBank: Users hold funds in accounts
• Kredo: Users never hold funds, only prove spending rights

PRIVACY:
• PumpBank: Account balances are tracked
• Kredo: No balances, no accounts, no tracking

SECURITY MODEL:
• PumpBank: Secure your password = secure your money
• Kredo: Prove authorization = spend without custody risk

ON-CHAIN STATE:
• PumpBank: Per-user accounts stored
• Kredo: Zero user state, only liquidity pools

WORKING PRODUCT:
Dashboard launching with:
✓ Virtual cards (CRUD operations)
✓ Email + OTP auth (passwordless)
✓ SQLite backend (persistent)
✓ Toast notifications (modern UX)
✓ Freeze/unfreeze cards
✓ Real-time updates

We're not competing with PumpBank.
We're in a different category entirely.

They optimize banking.
We eliminate accounts.

## Ultra-Bullish Short Version

```
What makes Kredo superior?

We don't have accounts.

Not "better accounts"
Not "decentralized accounts"
Not "private accounts"

NO ACCOUNTS.

You can't hack what doesn't exist.

Banking without accounts.
The new standard.

## Response to Roadmap Question (Q3 2026 Debit Cards)

**Question:** "Can you ask them about the roadmap? They say Q3 2026 for debit cards while they showcased a demo this morning with virtual cards"

**Answer:**

```
Great catch! Let me clarify the timeline:

🔬 WHAT'S LIVE NOW (Devnet):
• Virtual Cards - fully functional
• Authorization-based spending
• Zero-knowledge proof system
• Accountless architecture

📅 Q3 2026 TIMELINE:
Physical debit cards require official VISA partnership + compliance:

🔐 SECURITY CERTIFICATIONS:
• ISO 27001 (Information Security)
• PCI DSS Level 1 (Payment Card Industry)
• SOC 2 Type II (Service Organization)
• GDPR/CCPA compliance

🏛️ REGULATORY APPROVALS:
• VISA Partner Program application
• Financial services licensing
• KYC/AML framework verification
• Cross-border payment authorizations

⚡ WHY Q3 2026:
Not a technical limitation - it's compliance.

We're building the first accountless financial OS.
Regulators need to understand authorization ≠ custody.

We're optimistic we can move faster, but Q3 is our conservative estimate to ensure we pass every audit.

The tech works.
The cards work.
The authorization system works.

Now we prove it's secure enough for VISA.

Virtual cards = live now
Physical cards = Q3 2026 (pending compliance)

Banking without accounts.
Even compliance can't stop us.

$KREDO
```

## Shorter Version

```
Virtual cards = live now (devnet)
Physical cards = Q3 2026

Why Q3? Compliance, not code.

We need:
• VISA Partner Program approval
• ISO 27001 certification
• PCI DSS Level 1
• Regulatory framework verification

The tech works. The demo proves it.
Now we prove it's secure enough for VISA.

Q3 is conservative. We're pushing to ship faster.

## Technical Explanation Version

```
Virtual cards are live on devnet.

Physical debit cards = Q3 2026 because:

1. VISA PARTNERSHIP
   Official partner program requires:
   • Financial services license
   • PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
   • ISO 27001 security certification

2. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
   First accountless financial OS means:
   • New compliance categories
   • Authorization ≠ custody (regulators need to understand)
   • Cross-border payment authorizations

3. SECURITY AUDITS
   • SOC 2 Type II
   • Penetration testing
   • Third-party security reviews

The technology is ready.
The authorization system works.
The cards function perfectly.

Q3 2026 = conservative estimate for compliance approval.

We're shipping code while building compliance.
Not the other way around.

## Ultra-Confident Version

```
Virtual cards = shipping now
Physical cards = Q3 2026

Why the gap?

We're not building a better bank.
We're building banking without accounts.

Regulators have never seen this before.

VISA needs to understand:
• Authorization ≠ custody
• Zero-knowledge proofs = compliance
• Accountless = more secure, not less

Q3 2026 is our conservative estimate.

We're pushing to move faster.

The tech works.
The demo proves it.
Now we prove it to VISA.

Banking without accounts.
Even compliance can't stop us.
